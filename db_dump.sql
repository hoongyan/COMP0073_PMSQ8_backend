He had contacted me using +6596137418. \nHe claimed that workers employed under my details had illegal employment. \nWhen I denied knowledge of these workers, the call was transferred via WhatsApp to a second individual named Inspector William Wong, claiming to be from the Singapore Police Force. \nHe instructed me to transfer money to a bank account to support the investigations. As I was scared, I complied with his requests. As a result, I made the following transaction:\nA transaction of $27141.60 was made to CITIBANK account 39427881 on 2025-02-14.\nI realized I had been scammed when the individuals became uncontactable.
